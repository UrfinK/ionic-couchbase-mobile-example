Project
================
This is example of using my ng data provider for Couchbase mobile.

Installation
================
1. cordova plugin add https://github.com/couchbaselabs/Couchbase-Lite-PhoneGap-Plugin.git
2. ionic platform add ios

Develop
================
If you want to develop your app in browser, you'll need local instance of Couchbase mobile (it's Couchdb).
I prepared virtual machine with the database. But you have to have Vagrant and Virtualbox. So install those things and run:

1. cd vagrant
2. vagrant up
3. run index.html - (if you're using Jetbrains product, click right and click open in browser)
4. develop util the end of your project
